# FizzBuzzBazz
Extended game of FizzBuzz in variety of programing languages with complexity of O(1)<br />
(since the range is static = 100)(but if the range = n complexity would be O(n))<br />
In this game when the numer is dividable by
* 3 - print "Fizz"
* 5 - print "Buzz"
* 7 - print "Bazz"

The rules accumulate e.g.
if number is dividable by both 3 and 5 - print "FizzBuzz"
