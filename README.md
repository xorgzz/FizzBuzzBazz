# FizzBuzzBazz
Extended game of FizzBuzz in variety of programing languages with complexity of O(1)
(since the range is static (100) but if it was n numbers it would be O(n))
In this game when the numer is dividable by
* 3 - print "Fizz"
* 5 - print "Buzz"
* 7 - print "Bazz"

The rules accumulate e.g.
if number is dividable by both 3 and 5 - print "FizzBuzz"
